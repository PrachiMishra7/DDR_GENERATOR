THERMAL IMAGING REPORT
Property: 45 Oak Avenue, Unit 12B
Date: January 28, 2025
Technician: Lisa Chen
Equipment: FLIR T540 Thermal Camera

THERMAL FINDINGS:

Master Bedroom - North Wall:
Image 1 (Ceiling):
- Cold spot detected: Temperature reading 58°F (14.4°C)
- Surrounding area: 68°F (20°C)
- Temperature differential: 10°F indicates moisture presence
- Pattern consistent with water infiltration

Image 2 (Wall below window):
- Irregular cold zones detected
- Temperature range: 60-63°F (15.5-17.2°C)
- Room temperature: 68°F (20°C)
- Cold pattern extends vertically from window sill
- Shape suggests water migration path

Image 3 (Window frame):
- Thermal bridging detected at window frame
- Air infiltration visible as cooler area around perimeter
- Temperature drop of 8°F at frame edges

Attic Space Above Bedroom:
Image 4:
- Wet insulation shows as cold mass: 52°F (11°C)
- Dry insulation: 65°F (18.3°C)
- Cold zone approximately 4 feet x 3 feet in size
- Corresponds to bedroom stain location

ANALYSIS:
Thermal imaging confirms active moisture presence in ceiling and wall areas. Temperature differentials strongly indicate ongoing water infiltration rather than historical staining. The cold signature in attic insulation suggests roof-related water entry.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Immediate investigation of roof integrity required. Thermal data supports hypothesis of active leak requiring urgent remediation.
